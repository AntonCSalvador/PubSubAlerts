This script auto texts you for pub subs. I put my phone number in (+19048640615) but 
make sure you put your own and you good.

Also gotta open the task scheduler on your OS and create a new task and put
the script.py for every Thursday.

Specify the command to run your Python script: In the task configuration, provide the command to run your 
Python script using the appropriate Python interpreter.  

Command might be:
python3 /path/to/your/script.py
Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the actual path to your Python script.

Save and enable the task: Save the task configuration and enable it. 
The task scheduler will now execute your Python script every Wednesday at the specified time.
